# Spack Updater Documentation

Welcome to the Spack Updater Documentation! ðŸ‘‹  This is a series of simple actions that you
can maintain on your own fork alongside spack packages (package.py files) that will:

 - **1.** be automatically updated with new versions
 - **2.** have builds tested against spack develop nightly
 - **3.** assist with opening pull requests on your package changes
 - **4.** update your packages with spack upstream changes

Check out the user guide for how to create your own spack updater fork and use the actions, 
or visit one of the example repositories below to see them in action!

## Examples

The following organizations have deployed a spack updater repository!

 - **[flux-framework/spack](https://github.com/flux-framework/spack)**: the original repository where the actions were developed.
